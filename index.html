        💌 <p>My Ayu, <br>

            First, I want to say sorry from the bottom of my heart. Nijam ga cheppali ante, I didn’t ask you out earlier because I thought Valentine’s Day was silly. But when I realized how much it meant to you and how sad you felt, nak chala bada anipichindi. The last thing I ever want is to see you upset because of me. Nuvvu happy ga untay, naaku anthe chalu. I know I made a mistake, and trust me, inkaa ela ayina naaku nee meeda prema chupinchali ani undi.
            
            These two years with you have been the most beautiful part of my life. Even though we are far away, naa hrudayam motham nee tho full occupy ayi unde. Every morning, my first thought is you, and every night before I sleep, I wish you were right next to me. I know long-distance is not easy, but nuvvu naa pakkana unte, ye distance, ye kashtam aina kastam ani anipiyadu.
            
            I love the way you understand me, the way you make me feel special, and the way you bring so much happiness into my life. Nuvvu maatladinapudu, nee navvu chusinapudu, naaku anipistadi—ye lokam lo, naaku nee kante mukhyamaina vadu leru. I might not always say it perfectly, but please know that naa jeevitham lo neeku unna place eppatiki evaru theesukoleru.
            
            So, naa priya jeevitha sakhi (kinda cringe but ye), will you be my Valentine? I want to make it up to you. I want to make you feel as special as you truly are. I want to remind you every day how much I love you, how much I miss you, and how I can’t wait for the day when distance won’t be in between us anymore. Appatiki varaku, naa gundello nee kosam oka chinna, kaani chala deep place epudu undipothundi.
            <br>
            I love you, chala chala ekkuva. ❤️
            <br><br>
            Forever yours,<br>
            Ani
